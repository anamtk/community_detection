## Recap

We are exploring fish communities in the SBC-LTER associated with the project "Ongoing time-series of giant kelp forest community dynamics (KFCD)". We are exploring long-term community stability dynamics and how they are shaped by environmental factors. Our guiding question is:

How is community stability through time shaped by environmental factors?

## Approach

```{r}
#| include: false
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
